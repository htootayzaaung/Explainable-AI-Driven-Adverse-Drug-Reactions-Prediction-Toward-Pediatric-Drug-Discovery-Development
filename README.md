## Repository contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CCLE_expression.ipynb** | Loads the full CCLE expression matrix (1,406 cell lines Ã— 19,221 transcripts), filters to the 753 COSMIC Cancer-Gene-Census genes, renames columns to gene symbols, and saves `CCLE_expression_cleaned.csv` for downstream merging. |
| **01_data_prep.ipynb** | Cleans the GDSC2 dose-response table, converts raw ICâ‚…â‚€ values to natural-log scale, maps **COSMIC ID â†’ DepMap ID** so cell-line names align with CCLE, drops drugs without valid SMILES strings, and outputs three tidy CSVs covering compounds, cell lines, and activity labels. |
| **02_gen_dataset.ipynb** | Merges the cleaned ICâ‚…â‚€ data with compound and cell-line metadata, produces both **classification** (sensitive vs resistant) and **regression** (ln ICâ‚…â‚€) tables, performs a stratified 60 / 20 / 20 trainâ€“validationâ€“test split, and saves the CSVs under `datasets/sensitivity/â€¦`. |
| **Data Integration & Preparation.ipynb** | Combines the activity labels, the 735-gene expression profiles, and 2,048-bit Morgan fingerprints to form a **2,783-feature multimodal matrix** covering 108,696 drugâ€“cell-line pairs, applies feature scaling, and exports the dataset as a 6.9 GB `.pkl` and a 1.6 GB `.csv`. |
| **Model Development & Training.ipynb** | Trains a dual-branch multimodal encoder with **8-head cross-modal attention**, trains on an NVIDIA A100, and saves `best_multimodal_model.keras`. |
| **Explainable AI-Driven ADR Prediction Report.pdf** | Technical report summarising biological motivation, data pipeline, model architecture, performance metrics, and interpretability findings. |
| **My Notes.pdf** | Research journal: captures the running rationale behind each processing step, design trade-offs, hyper-parameter grids, exploratory questions, and etc. |
